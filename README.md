# Data Science and Machine Learning

Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning repository! This repository contains the projects, exercises,
and code I have developed during my learning journey through Udemy's data science and machine learning courses.

## Introduction
In this repository, you'll find a variety of data science and machine learning projects, including data analysis, predictive modeling, and more.
This is my way of practicing and applying what I've learned from Udemy courses to real-world problems. Feel free to explore the projects and code,
and use them as a reference for your own learning journey.

## Projects
1. **Project 1:** [Capstone-Project](https://github.com/BalakaMd/Data-science-and-Machine-learning/blob/main/Capstone-Project.ipynb)
   
   The goal of the project is to follow the steps based on the fivethirtyeight.com article about ratings and see if we can come to the same conclusions as in the article.
   You will use your pandas and data visualization skills to determine whether Fandango was providing inflated ratings in 2015 in order to sell more tickets.

3. **Project 2:** [DBSCAN-Project](https://github.com/BalakaMd/Data-science-and-Machine-learning/blob/main/DBSCAN-Project-Exercises.ipynb)
   
   DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) -
   exercises on clustering based on data density

5. **Project 3:** [Kmeans-Clustering](https://github.com/BalakaMd/Data-science-and-Machine-learning/blob/main/Kmeans-Clustering-Project-Exercises.ipynb)
   
   Target: Find countries and regions that are similar to each other by experimenting with different numbers of clusters.
   What do the resulting clusters mean?
   
7. **Project 4:** [Logistic-Regression-Project](https://github.com/BalakaMd/Data-science-and-Machine-learning/blob/main/Logistic-Regression-Project-Exercise.ipynb)
   
   Objective: Create a classification model to predict whether a patient has signs of heart disease based on that person's physical characteristics (age, gender, cholesterol, etc.)

9. **Project 5:** [Matplotlib Exercises](https://github.com/BalakaMd/Data-science-and-Machine-learning/blob/main/Matplotlib%20Exercises.ipynb)
    
   We will solve two problems:
   - display on a graph the relationship between variables based on the equation
   - display a ready set of points
     
11. **Project 6:** [PCA-Exercise-Project](https://github.com/BalakaMd/Data-science-and-Machine-learning/blob/main/PCA-Exercise-Project-Overview.ipynb)
    
    Goal: Use principal component analysis to find out which handwritten numbers differ most from each other.
   
11. **Project 7:** [Pandas-Project-Exercise](https://github.com/BalakaMd/Data-science-and-Machine-learning/blob/main/Pandas-Project-Exercise.ipynb)
    
    Lots of exercises on using the Pandas library
   
13. **Project 8:** [SVM-Project-Exercise](https://github.com/BalakaMd/Data-science-and-Machine-learning/blob/main/SVM-Project-Exercise.ipynb)
    
    Project goals:
    A wine distribution company recently encountered counterfeits. As a result, an audit of various wines was carried out using chemical analysis.
    The company exports very high-quality and expensive wines, but one of the suppliers tried to sell cheap wine under the guise of a more expensive one.
    A distribution company has hired you to create a machine learning model that will predict poor quality wine (i.e., “fake”).
    They want to know if it is possible to tell the difference between cheap and expensive wines.

15. **Project 9:** [Seaborn-Exercise](https://github.com/BalakaMd/Data-science-and-Machine-learning/blob/main/Seaborn-Exercise.ipynb)

    Lots of exercises on using the Seaborn library

17. **Project 10:** [Sup-Learning-Capstone](https://github.com/BalakaMd/Data-science-and-Machine-learning/blob/main/Sup-Learning-Capstone-Tree-Methods.ipynb)

    GOAL: Create a model for predicting whether a subscriber will churn.

## Courses
Here are the Udemy courses that have contributed to the knowledge and code in this repository:

1. [Machine Learning & Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-machine-learning-data-science-russian/)
   Description of the course from Udemy:
   This course is the best way to start from scratch and become a data scientist and machine learning expert using Python.
   This is the Russian version of the course that Jose and his team have been preparing for over a year. And this is after more than 2 million students took the previous courses.
   This voluminous course can replace you with a whole set of other courses that can cost tens of times more.

3. [Data Science and Machine Learning in Python 3 from scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-python-3/)
   Description of the course from Udemy:
   This comprehensive course will be your guide to learning how to harness the power of Python to analyze data,
    create beautiful visualizations, and use powerful machine learning algorithms!
   

## Getting Started
To run and explore the projects in this repository, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here are the general steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BalakaMd/Data-science-and-Machine-learning.git
   

2. Install the necessary dependencies, which may vary depending on the project. You can typically find the specific requirements in each project's README or code comments.

3. Start experimenting with the code, exploring the projects, and adapting them for your own use.
